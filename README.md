## Quick Start

* If you have installed the PAIN dataset on your computer (Lucey, Patrick, et al. "Painful data: The UNBC-McMaster shoulder pain expression archive database." Face and Gesture 2011. IEEE, 2011.), then just run the script.
* If you want to analyse your own FACS dataset, please read it in in a tabular fashion where each column presents a specific AU and each row a facial configuration in your dataset.
